## Contents  

1. To identify cracks in different buildings, followed by analysis to identify their possible reasons 
and to find appropriate treatment strategies. 
2. Corrosion of RC components, its identification, background causes and remedial measures 
based on analysis. 
3. Deflection of structural members, problem identification and treatment strategies. 
4. Settlement of a structure, its causes, and measures to control it. 
5. Structural Health monitoring, problem identification and NDT to quantify the problem. 
6. Analysis of RC structural components using non-linear analysis software.
