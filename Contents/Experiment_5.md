# Experiment 5: Structural Health Monitoring and Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)

## 1. Aim

To perform structural health monitoring and non-destructive testing (NDT) on RC structures to identify defects such as cracks, corrosion, and material deterioration, and to suggest remedial and preventive measures.

## 2. Objectives

* To understand principles of structural health monitoring (SHM).
* To demonstrate and perform NDT techniques:

  * Rebound Hammer Test (surface hardness and quality of concrete)
  * Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) Test (internal defects and uniformity)
  * Half-Cell Potential Measurement (corrosion assessment of reinforcement)
* To record observations systematically with properly captured photographs.
* To analyze test results in light of IS code provisions and case studies from literature.

## 3. Theoretical Background

* **Structural Health Monitoring (SHM):** Systematic assessment of structural condition to detect deterioration and prevent failures.
* **Rebound Hammer Test:** Measures surface hardness of concrete and provides an estimate of compressive strength.

  * **IS Code:** IS 516 (Part 5/Sec 4) 2020    
* **Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) Test:** Measures the velocity of ultrasonic waves through concrete to detect cracks, voids, or non-uniformity.

  * **IS Code:** IS 516 (Part 5/Sec 1): 2018
* **Half-Cell Potential Measurement:** Detects likelihood of reinforcement corrosion based on electrochemical potential.
  * **IS Code:** IS 516 (Part 5/Sec 2): 2021    
* Students are encouraged to consult case studies in literature to understand practical SHM applications and remedial strategies.

## 4. Procedure *(Sample – for reference only)*

1. Select RC members (beams, slabs, columns, walls) for NDT.
2. **Rebound Hammer Test:**

   * Clean surface of concrete.
   * Take multiple readings at each location and calculate average rebound index.
3. **UPV Test:**

   * Place transducers on opposite faces of the member.
   * Record pulse velocity at multiple points.
4. **Half-Cell Potential Measurement:**

   * Connect reference electrode to reinforcement.
   * Measure potential at several locations to identify corrosion-prone areas.
5. Record all observations systematically with **properly captured, labelled, numbered, and captioned photographs**.
6. Analyze results to identify defects, estimate severity, and suggest remedial or preventive measures.

## 5. Observations & Data Recording *(Sample Table – for reference only)*

| Sr. No. | Location / Member | Test Type           | Reading / Value | Interpretation / Defect Indication | Suggested Action                        |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Beam near support | Rebound Hammer      | 35–40           | Good quality concrete              | No immediate action                     |
| 2       | Slab soffit       | UPV                 | 3.2 km/s        | Minor internal cracks              | Monitor and repair if cracks propagate  |
| 3       | Column exterior   | Half-Cell Potential | -350 mV         | Corrosion likely                   | Apply corrosion inhibitor, patch repair |
| 4       | Wall              | Rebound Hammer      | 25              | Low strength area                  | Strengthening / concrete repair         |

*Students must record a minimum of 5–6 locations/tests, with photographs **properly captured, numbered, labelled, and captioned** in their report.*

## 6. Analysis *(Sample – for reference only)*

* Compare measured readings with acceptable ranges in IS codes.
* Identify areas with probable material deterioration or reinforcement corrosion.
* Correlate results from different NDT methods for validation.
* Include insights from at least one relevant case study in literature.

## 7. Treatment Strategies *(Sample – for reference only)*

* Surface repair or patching for localized defects.
* Corrosion inhibitors or protective coatings for reinforcement.
* Structural strengthening using external supports or fiber-reinforced polymers.
* Implement preventive monitoring for long-term structural health.

## 8. Results *(Sample – for reference only)*

* Defects detected and severity assessment.
* Recommendations for remediation.
* Preventive maintenance suggestions.
* Reference to IS codes and literature for validation.
