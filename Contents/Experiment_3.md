# Experiment 3: Study of Deflection in Structural Members

## 1. Aim

To observe deflection in structural members, identify related problems, analyze possible reasons, and suggest suitable treatment and preventive strategies.

## 2. Objectives

* To study the nature and extent of deflections in beams, slabs, and other structural members.
* To identify structural and serviceability issues caused by excessive deflection.
* To analyze possible reasons for observed deflections.
* To propose remedial and preventive measures for minimizing deflections.
* To relate findings with provisions of relevant IS codes and explore case studies from literature for practical understanding.

## 3. Theoretical Background

Deflection in structural members refers to the displacement of a member under load. While some deflection is inevitable and permissible, excessive deflection can affect aesthetics, functionality, and structural safety.

* **Common causes**: overloading, insufficient stiffness, poor quality of materials, creep, shrinkage, or improper design.
* **IS Codes**:

  * IS 456: 2000 (Plain and Reinforced Concrete – Code of Practice) specifies permissible deflections for RC structures.
  * IS 800: 2007 (General Construction in Steel – Code of Practice) provides deflection limits for steel structures.
* Students are encouraged to go through **case studies in literature** to understand real-life implications of excessive deflection and its remedies.

## 4. Procedure *(Sample – for reference only)*

1. Select structural members such as beams, slabs, or cantilevers in nearby buildings.
2. Observe any visible deflections or serviceability issues (e.g., sagging, cracks due to bending).
3. Record details including location, span, member size, visible deflection (if measurable), and associated issues.
4. Capture **clear, properly labelled, captioned, and numbered photographs** of observed cases.
5. Compare observations with permissible limits specified in IS codes.
6. Analyze possible reasons for excessive deflection.
7. Suggest treatment and preventive measures supported by IS codes and case studies.

## 5. Observations & Data Recording *(Sample Table – for reference only)*

| Sr. No. | Structural Member   | Span/Size | Observed Deflection (approx.) | Possible Cause         | Effect on Structure/Serviceability | Suggested Remedy                             |
| ------- | ------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | RCC Beam (mid-span) | 4.5 m     | \~15 mm                       | Overloading, creep     | Sagging, plaster cracks            | External prestressing, section strengthening |
| 2       | Slab panel          | 3 m × 4 m | \~10 mm                       | Insufficient thickness | Ponding of water, tile cracks      | Increase slab depth (future), add topping    |

*Students must fill a minimum of 5–6 entries with **properly captured, labelled, numbered, and captioned photographs** attached in their report.*

## 6. Analysis *(Sample – for reference only)*

* Compare observed deflections with permissible limits from IS codes.
* Discuss whether deflections are within safe/unsafe limits.
* Correlate observations with possible material, structural, or environmental causes.
* Support analysis with at least one relevant case study from literature.

## 7. Treatment Strategies *(Sample – for reference only)*

* Structural strengthening (jacketing, addition of supports, external prestressing).
* Load reduction or redistribution where feasible.
* Use of stiffer materials in future construction.
* Preventive measures like adequate member sizing, proper reinforcement detailing, and control of long-term effects (creep and shrinkage).

## 8. Results *(Sample – for reference only)*

* Nature and extent of deflections observed.
* Comparison with permissible values from IS codes.
* Causes and possible impacts of observed deflections.
* Suggested remedies and preventive strategies.
* Insights from related case studies.

## 10. Viva Questions *(Sample: for reference only - Do not write in the final report)*

1. What are the permissible limits of deflection in beams as per IS 456?
2. How does creep and shrinkage influence deflection in RCC members?
3. What are the main differences between short-term and long-term deflection?
4. How do deflection criteria differ for RCC and steel members?
5. Can you name a case study where excessive deflection led to structural/serviceability failure?
