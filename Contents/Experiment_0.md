# Experiment 0: Defect Mapping and Condition Survey of GNDEC Campus Buildings

## 1. Aim

To map and document defects in different GNDEC campus buildings, followed by analysis to determine their possible causes and to suggest appropriate treatment and preventive strategies.

## 2. Objectives

* To conduct a comprehensive **defect survey** of GNDEC campus buildings.
* To identify and classify **all types of visible defects** (cracks, spalling, leakage, corrosion, settlement, dampness, etc.).
* To prepare a **defect map / condition survey sheet** of assigned buildings.
* To analyze possible causes of observed defects.
* To suggest suitable **treatment and preventive measures**.
* To relate findings with relevant IS codes and available **case studies** in literature.

## 3. Theoretical Background

Building defects may arise from material deterioration, poor construction practices, aging, environmental exposure, structural overloading, or inadequate maintenance. Defect mapping is an essential tool in **structural health monitoring** to assess serviceability and safety, prioritize maintenance, and plan rehabilitation.
Relevant IS codes include:

* IS 456:2000 (Plain and Reinforced Concrete)
* IS 15988:2013 (Seismic Evaluation and Strengthening of Existing RC Buildings)
* IS 13670:2003 (Inspection of Concrete Structures)

Students should also review **case studies** from literature related to building condition surveys and rehabilitation projects to gain deeper insights.

## 4. Procedure *(Sample â€“ for reference only)*

1. Select the assigned GNDEC campus building(s).
2. Perform a **systematic walk-through survey** covering structural and non-structural components.
3. Capture **clear, properly labelled, numbered, and captioned photographs** of observed defects.
4. Record defect details: type, location, extent, severity, and possible associated conditions.
5. Prepare a **defect map / sketch plan** marking the location of defects.
6. Analyze the observed defects to identify recurring issues and probable causes.
7. Suggest **treatment and preventive measures** for each major defect.
8. Relate observations to provisions of IS codes and at least one **case study** from literature.

## 5. Observations & Data Recording *(Sample Table â€“ for reference only)*

| Sr. No. | Location (Building Element) | Type of Defect            | Approx. Extent / Severity | Possible Cause                            | Suggested Remedy                         |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1       | RCC Beam, Library Block     | Spalling + exposed rebars | ~1.5 m length, severe     | Corrosion of reinforcement, water ingress | Patch repair, anti-corrosion coating     |
| 2       | Roof slab, Classroom Block  | Dampness + water leakage  | Moderate, spread ~3 mÂ²    | Poor waterproofing, rainwater ingress     | Waterproofing treatment, drainage repair |
| 3       | External wall, Hostel       | Plaster peeling           | ~2 mÂ² area                | Poor bonding, moisture penetration        | Replastering with bonding agent          |

ðŸ‘‰ Students must prepare a **minimum of 10â€“12 entries** with **photographs properly captured, labelled, numbered, and captioned**, along with **defect maps/sketches** included in their report.

## 6. Analysis *(Sample â€“ for reference only)*

* Categorize defects as **structural vs non-structural**.
* Identify recurring issues in specific blocks or building elements.
* Correlate defects with **environmental, material, or usage-related factors**.
* Compare observations with IS code provisions.
* Support conclusions with at least one **case study** from literature.

## 7. Treatment Strategies *(Sample â€“ for reference only)*

* **Spalling & corrosion**: Concrete patch repair, anti-corrosion treatment, jacketing.
* **Dampness & leakage**: Waterproofing, drainage improvement, plaster renewal.
* **Settlement & cracks**: Grouting, underpinning, strengthening.
* **Preventive measures**: Periodic maintenance, proper curing, quality materials, improved detailing.

## 8. Results *(Sample â€“ for reference only)*

* Summary of number and types of defects mapped.
* Preparation of **defect maps** for assigned buildings.
* Probable causes identified and linked to structural/environmental factors.
* Suggested remedial and preventive strategies.
* Reference to IS codes and relevant case studies.

* How does spalling differ from cracking?
* Which IS codes are relevant to condition surveys of buildings?
* What preventive measures can reduce the occurrence of defects?
* Can you relate your observations with any real-world rehabilitation case study?
