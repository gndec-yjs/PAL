# Problem Analysis Laboratory – Guidelines

This page provides all instructions and guidelines for completing the laboratory exercises, submitting reports, and understanding course expectations.

## 1. Overview of the Lab

The course focuses on identifying and analyzing structural defects in RC structures, understanding their causes, and applying treatment or preventive measures. Students will learn:

* Defect identification (cracks, corrosion, deflection, settlement)
* Structural Health Monitoring and NDT techniques
* Non-linear analysis of RC components using ATENA software

Students are expected to follow instructions carefully, document observations, and analyze results critically.

## 2. Experiments

Students must complete **6 experiments** in sequence. Observations, analysis, treatment strategies, and results must be documented in their reports. Properly captured, numbered, labelled, and captioned photographs/screenshots are required wherever applicable.

## 3. Experiment Sequence

* **Experiments 1–4:**
  Students will capture photographs of building defects (cracks, corrosion, deflection, settlement), analyze possible causes, and suggest treatment strategies. These experiments can be performed simultaneously as they involve observation, data recording, and analysis.

* **Experiment 5:**
  Instructor demonstration of NDT techniques (Rebound Hammer, UPV, Half-Cell Potential) followed by student hands-on practice.

* **Experiment 6:**
  Non-linear analysis using ATENA. Students are expected to follow the official tutorial [ATENA Engineering 3D Tutorial PDF](https://www.cervenka.cz/assets/files/atena-pdf/ATENA-Engineering-3D_Tutorial.pdf) and software instructions [Cervenka ATENA Documentation](https://www.cervenka.cz/products/atena/documentation/).

## 4. Report Guidelines

1. All reports must be **typed**; handwritten submissions will not be accepted.
2. Use a **clear and uniform format** for all experiments.
3. Include the following sections in your report:

   * Aim
   * Objectives
   * Theoretical Background
   * Procedure *(Sample – for reference only)*
   * Observations & Data Recording *(with properly labelled photographs/screenshots)*
   * Analysis *(Sample – for reference only)*
   * Treatment / Preventive Measures *(Sample – for reference only)*
   * Results *(Sample – for reference only)*
   * Viva Questions *(Sample – for reference only)*
4. Include references to **relevant IS codes** and **case studies from literature** to strengthen your analysis.
5. Ensure photographs and screenshots are **properly captured, numbered, labelled, and captioned**.

## 5. Submission Instructions

* Reports must be submitted in **PDF format**.
* Use the following **file naming convention:**

  ```
  Experiment_X_YourName_RollNo.pdf
  ```

  Example: `Experiment_1_YuvrajSingh_101.pdf`
* Submit reports through the **GitHub repository** designated for the course.
* Include links to ATENA project files or any digital data files where applicable.
* Keep a **backup copy** of all submissions.

---

## 6. Important Notes

* All content provided in the experiments (procedure, analysis, treatment strategies, results, sample tables) is **for reference only**. Students should **customize based on the actual observations** from their identified defects.
* Students are encouraged to consult **relevant IS codes** and **literature/case studies** for deeper understanding and accurate analysis.
* Safety precautions must be followed while performing inspections or tests.
