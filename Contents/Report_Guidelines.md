# Report & Submission Guidelines

This page provides detailed instructions on **how to document, format, and submit reports** for the Problem Analysis Laboratory (LPECE-102).

## 1. Experiment List & Links

Students must complete **6 experiments** in sequence. Observations, analysis, treatment strategies, and results must be documented in their reports. Properly captured, numbered, labelled, and captioned photographs/screenshots are required wherever applicable.

| Experiment No. | Title                                                          | Link                                |

## 3. Submission Instructions

* Reports must be submitted in **PDF format**.
* Use the following **file naming convention:**

  ```
  Experiment_X_YourName_RollNo.pdf
  ```

  Example: `Experiment_1_YuvrajSingh_101.pdf`
* Submit reports through the **designated GitHub repository**.
* Include any **ATENA project files or digital data** where applicable.
* Maintain a **backup copy** of all submissions.

## 4. Important Notes

* All content provided in the experiments (procedure, analysis, treatment strategies, results, sample tables) is **for reference only**. Students should **customize based on actual observations** from their identified defects.
* Students are encouraged to consult **relevant IS codes** and **literature/case studies** for accurate analysis.
* Safety precautions must be followed while performing inspections or tests.
