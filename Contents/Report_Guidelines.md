## 4. Important Notes

* All content provided in the experiments (procedure, analysis, treatment strategies, results, sample tables) is **for reference only**. Students should **customize based on actual observations** from their identified defects.
* Students are encouraged to consult **relevant IS codes** and **literature/case studies** for accurate analysis.
* Safety precautions must be followed while performing inspections or tests.
