# Lab Workflow & Stages

This page provides an overview of the **Problem Analysis Laboratory (LPECE-102)**, including the purpose, learning outcomes, and stage-wise workflow for completing all experiments.

## 1. Introduction / Overview

The **Problem Analysis Laboratory** is designed to train students in identifying, analyzing, and suggesting solutions for structural defects commonly observed in real-world civil engineering practice. The lab combines:

* **Visual inspection and documentation**
* **Hands-on practice with basic monitoring and testing techniques**
* **Analytical modeling and software-based evaluation**

---

## 2. General Purpose of the Lab

* Develop skills to **recognize different types of structural defects** such as cracks, corrosion, deflection, and settlement.
* Understand **possible causes** of deterioration and suggest appropriate **treatment or preventive measures**.
* Learn to **quantify defects** using simple monitoring tools and NDT methods.
* Apply **engineering analysis and software modeling** (ATENA) to evaluate the effect of defects on structural performance.
* Integrate observations, test results, and analysis into a **comprehensive problem analysis report**.

## 3. Learning Outcomes

On completion of this lab, students will be able to:

1. Identify and document cracks, corrosion, deflection, and settlement in structures.
2. Analyze possible reasons for observed defects.
3. Suggest suitable treatment or preventive measures for structural problems.
4. Conduct basic structural health monitoring and use NDT techniques.
5. Perform non-linear analysis of RC structural components using ATENA.
6. Compile a complete lab report integrating field observations, test data, and analytical evaluation.

## 4. Stage-wise Workflow

### Stage 1: Visual Survey & Documentation (Experiments 1â€“4)

**Objective:**
Develop the ability to **recognize, record, and analyze visible signs of structural distress** in nearby buildings or campus structures.

**Tasks for Students:**

* Capture **self-taken photographs** of the following defects:

  1. **Cracks** in walls, beams, slabs, or columns.
  2. **Corrosion of RC components** (rust stains, spalling, exposed reinforcement).
  3. **Deflection of structural members** (beams, slabs, roofs).
  4. **Settlement of structures** (differential settlement, tilting, floor sinking).

* For each observation:

  * Note **location & context**.
  * Identify **possible causes** (material degradation, design flaws, poor maintenance).
  * Suggest **preventive or corrective measures** (repair methods, materials, control strategies).

ðŸ“Œ *Experiments 1â€“4 will be completed simultaneously as part of your personal field documentation portfolio.*

### Stage 2: Structural Health Monitoring & Quantification (Experiment 5)

**Objective:**
Move beyond visual inspection by applying **basic monitoring and testing techniques** to quantify deterioration.

**Instructor Demonstration + Student Practice:**

* Introduction to **Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)** concepts.

* Demonstration of **Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) methods**, such as:

  * Rebound Hammer
  * Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV)
  * Half-Cell Potential Test
  * Cover Meter
  * Moisture Meter
  * Crack Width Gauges

* Hands-on practice by students at selected locations.

**Student Role:**

* Record readings at identified defect locations.
* Compare findings with visual observations.
* Compile results into a **Defect Diagnosis Sheet**, including:

  * Type of defect
  * Possible cause
  * Test result / severity
  * Suggested treatment strategy

### Stage 3: Analytical Problem Solving (Experiment 6)

**Objective:**
Apply **engineering analysis and modeling tools** to study defects in a systematic way.

**Tasks:**

* Follow instructorâ€™s tutorial on ATENA software.
* Model a structural component or problem scenario (e.g., cracked beam, corroded slab section).
* Evaluate effects of deterioration on **performance parameters** such as load-carrying capacity, stiffness, and serviceability.
* Document outcomes as a **technical case study**.

ðŸ“Œ *Students are expected to begin practicing with ATENA tutorials early and progressively build their analytical case study in parallel with Stage 1 & Stage 2.*

---

### Stage 4: Synthesis & Reporting

**Objective:**
Integrate all observations, testing data, and analytical insights into a **comprehensive problem analysis report**.

**Deliverables:**

* **Photo-logbook** of observed defects.
* **Causeâ€“Effectâ€“Treatment chart** for each defect type.
* **NDT & monitoring results** with interpretations.
* **Analytical case study report** (software-based evaluation).
* **Final compiled lab manual submission** (Experiments 1â€“6).
