# Experiment 2: Identification and Analysis of Corrosion in RC Components


## 1. Aim

To study and identify the occurrence of corrosion in reinforced concrete (RC) components, analyze its possible reasons, and suggest suitable treatment strategies and preventive measures.

---

## 2. Objectives

* To visually identify symptoms of corrosion in RC elements.
* To analyze the possible reasons for corrosion occurrence.
* To record field observations systematically with photographs.
* To suggest treatment and preventive measures.

---

## 3. Apparatus / Requirements

* Camera / Smartphone (for capturing photographs)
* Field notebook and pen
* Measuring tape / scale
* Crack width gauge (if available)
* Magnifying glass (optional)

---

## 4. Procedure *(Sample – for reference only)*

1. Select RC structural components (beams, columns, slabs, staircases, retaining walls, etc.) from nearby buildings/structures.
2. Carefully observe and capture photographs of corrosion symptoms such as:

   * Rust stains on the concrete surface
   * Cracks and spalling exposing reinforcement
   * Loose cover concrete or delamination
3. Record details of each observation in a systematic format (see sample table below).
4. Identify possible causes behind the observed corrosion.
5. Suggest treatment and preventive strategies for each observation.

## 5. Observation & Data Recording *(Sample Table – for reference only)*

| Sr. No. | Location (Building Element)   | Symptom of Corrosion                    | Extent / Severity   | Possible Cause                                          | Suggested Remedy                                                                            |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.      | RCC Column at ground floor    | Rust stains, cracking of cover concrete | Localized, moderate | Water ingress through cracks, carbonation               | Remove loose cover, apply anti-corrosive coating, patch repair with polymer modified mortar |
| 2.      | Slab soffit near leakage area | Exposed reinforcement, spalled concrete | Severe              | Continuous water leakage, chloride attack               | Clean reinforcement, apply corrosion inhibitor, re-cast with micro-concrete                 |
| 3.      | Beam near external wall       | Brown streaks, slight delamination      | Mild                | Poor concrete cover, moisture penetration               | Surface coating, sealant application, ensure waterproofing                                  |
| 4.      | Staircase landing             | Localized corrosion patches             | Moderate            | Inadequate cover, exposure to wetting and drying cycles | Epoxy grouting, protective coating                                                          |
| 5.      | Retaining wall face           | Rust streaks along vertical cracks      | Severe              | Aggressive soil, poor drainage                          | Provide drainage, use cathodic protection, re-concrete damaged portion                      |

**Note:** Students must fill a **minimum of 5–6 entries** with photographs attached in their report. The photographs should be **properly captured, numbered, labeled, and captioned** for clarity.

## 6. Analysis *(Sample – for reference only)*

* Identify **possible reasons** for corrosion:

  * Inadequate cover thickness
  * Use of poor-quality concrete
  * Water seepage/leakage
  * Carbonation and chloride ingress
  * Exposure to aggressive environment (industrial, coastal, or soil conditions)
* Discuss how the defect can **reduce service life and strength** of the structure.

---

## 7. Treatment Strategies *(Sample – for reference only)*

* **Minor corrosion:** Clean surface, apply protective coating.
* **Moderate corrosion:** Remove loose concrete, clean bars, apply corrosion inhibitor, repair with polymer-modified mortar.
* **Severe corrosion:** Replace damaged concrete, add reinforcement if required, use micro-concrete/jacketing.

---

## 8. Preventive Measures *(Sample – for reference only)*

* Ensure adequate concrete cover during construction.
* Use high-quality concrete with low permeability.
* Provide waterproofing and drainage to prevent seepage.
* Use corrosion-resistant steel (CRS/TMT with coating).
* Apply protective coatings and perform regular maintenance checks.

---

## 9. Results *(Sample – for reference only)*

* Students will document:

  * Identified locations of corrosion in RC components.
  * Possible reasons for corrosion occurrence.
  * Suggested remedial and preventive measures.
