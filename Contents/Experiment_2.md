## 1. Aim

To study and identify the occurrence of corrosion in reinforced concrete (RC) components, analyze its possible reasons, and suggest suitable treatment strategies and preventive measures.

## 2. Objectives

* To visually identify symptoms of corrosion in RC elements.
* To analyze the possible reasons for corrosion occurrence.

* To suggest treatment and preventive measures.
* To relate the observations with provisions of relevant **IS codes**.

## 3. Apparatus / Requirements

* Camera / Smartphone (for capturing photographs)
* Field notebook and pen
* Measuring tape / scale
* Crack width gauge (if available)
* Magnifying glass (optional)
* Relevant IS Codes (e.g., IS 456:2000, IS 15988:2013, IS 5525, etc.)

## 4. Procedure *(Sample – for reference only)*

1. Select RC structural components (beams, columns, slabs, staircases, retaining walls, etc.) from nearby buildings/structures.
2. Carefully observe and capture photographs of corrosion symptoms such as:

   * Rust stains on the concrete surface
   * Cracks and spalling exposing reinforcement
   * Loose cover concrete or delamination
3. Record details of each observation in a systematic format (see sample table below).
4. Identify possible causes behind the observed corrosion.
5. Suggest treatment and preventive strategies for each observation.
6. Compare findings with recommendations of relevant IS codes.
7. Consult literature and case studies to better understand advanced repair and rehabilitation practices.

## 5. Observation & Data Recording *(Sample Table – for reference only)*

| Sr. No. | Location (Building Element)   | Symptom of Corrosion                    | Extent / Severity   | Possible Cause                                          | Suggested Remedy                                                                            |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.      | RCC Column at ground floor    | Rust stains, cracking of cover concrete | Localized, moderate | Water ingress through cracks, carbonation               | Remove loose cover, apply anti-corrosive coating, patch repair with polymer modified mortar |
| 2.      | Slab soffit near leakage area | Exposed reinforcement, spalled concrete | Severe              | Continuous water leakage, chloride attack               | Clean reinforcement, apply corrosion inhibitor, re-cast with micro-concrete                 |
| 3.      | Beam near external wall       | Brown streaks, slight delamination      | Mild                | Poor concrete cover, moisture penetration               | Surface coating, sealant application, ensure waterproofing                                  |
| 4.      | Staircase landing             | Localized corrosion patches             | Moderate            | Inadequate cover, exposure to wetting and drying cycles | Epoxy grouting, protective coating                                                          |
| 5.      | Retaining wall face           | Rust streaks along vertical cracks      | Severe              | Aggressive soil, poor drainage                          | Provide drainage, use cathodic protection, re-concrete damaged portion                      |

**Note:** Students must fill a **minimum of 5–6 entries** with photographs attached in their report. The photographs should be **properly captured, numbered, labeled, and captioned** for clarity.

## 6. Analysis *(Sample – for reference only)*

* Identify **possible reasons** for corrosion:

  * Inadequate cover thickness
  * Use of poor-quality concrete
  * Water seepage/leakage
  * Carbonation and chloride ingress
  * Exposure to aggressive environment (industrial, coastal, or soil conditions)
* Discuss how the defect can **reduce service life and strength** of the structure.
* Relate observations to IS code recommendations (e.g., cover requirements, durability clauses, repair standards).

## 7. Treatment Strategies *(Sample – for reference only)*

* **Minor corrosion:** Clean surface, apply protective coating.
* **Moderate corrosion:** Remove loose concrete, clean bars, apply corrosion inhibitor, repair with polymer-modified mortar.
* **Severe corrosion:** Replace damaged concrete, add reinforcement if required, use micro-concrete/jacketing.

## 8. Preventive Measures *(Sample – for reference only)*

* Ensure adequate concrete cover during construction (as per IS 456).
* Use high-quality concrete with low permeability.
* Provide waterproofing and drainage to prevent seepage.
* Use corrosion-resistant steel (CRS/TMT with coating).
* Apply protective coatings and perform regular maintenance checks.

## 9. Results *(Sample – for reference only)*

* Students will document:

  * Identified locations of corrosion in RC components.
  * Possible reasons for corrosion occurrence.
  * Suggested remedial and preventive measures.
  * Code-based recommendations and learnings from literature/case studies.
