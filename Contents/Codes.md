üìù *Note:*  
- This list includes **key codes relevant to defect identification, monitoring, and RC analysis**.  
- Students are encouraged to consult **additional IS codes, handbooks, and case studies** based on the specific structural problems they observe.  
- Always refer to the **latest versions of IS codes** from the [BIS portal](https://www.bis.gov.in) for your analysis and reporting.
