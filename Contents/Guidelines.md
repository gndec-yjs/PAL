# Problem Analysis Laboratory – Guidelines

This page provides **key links and instructions** for students.

## 1. Lab Workflow & Stages

Follow a structured workflow for all experiments:

- **Stage 1 (Experiment 0):** Defect Mapping and Condition Survey of GNDEC Campus Buildings
- **Stage 2 (Experiments 1–4):** Visual survey of defects (cracks, corrosion, deflection, settlement)  
- **Stage 3 (Experiment 5):** Structural Health Monitoring & NDT practice  
- **Stage 4 (Experiment 6):** Non-linear analysis using ATENA  
- **Stage 5:** Synthesis of observations, tests, and analysis into a final report  

**To View Detailed Workflow:** [**Click Here**](Lab_Workflow.md)

## 2. Reports & Submission

- Typed reports only (handwritten not accepted)  
- Include sections: Aim, Objectives, Procedure, Observations, Analysis, Treatment, Results, Viva Questions  
- Refer IS codes & case studies where applicable  
- PDF submission via **GitHub repository**  
- Naming convention: `Experiment_X_YourName_RollNo.pdf`

## 4. Notes

- Customize experiments based on actual observations  
- Photographs/screenshots must be numbered, labelled, and captioned  
- Follow safety precautions during inspections and tests  
- Use IS codes and literature for deeper analysis
