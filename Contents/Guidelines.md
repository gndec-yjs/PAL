# 📝 Guidelines: Problem Analysis Laboratory

This lab focuses on identifying, analyzing, and treating structural defects commonly observed in real-world civil engineering practice. The approach combines **visual inspection, hands-on practice with diagnostic tools, and systematic reporting**.

The work is structured in **stages**, guiding you from observation to problem quantification and proposed solutions.

## 🔹 Stage 1: Visual Survey & Documentation (Experiments 1–4)

**Objective:**
Develop the ability to recognize, record, and analyze visible signs of structural distress in nearby buildings or campus structures.

**Tasks for Students:**

* Capture **self-taken photographs** of the following defects as per syllabus:

  1. **Cracks** in walls, beams, slabs, or columns.
  2. **Corrosion of RC components** (rust stains, spalling, exposed reinforcement).
  3. **Deflection of structural members** (beams, slabs, roofs).
  4. **Settlement of structures** (differential settlement, tilting, floor sinking).

* For each observation:

  * Note down **location & context**.
  * Identify **possible causes** (material degradation, design flaws, poor maintenance, etc.).
  * Suggest **preventive and corrective measures** (repair methods, materials, control strategies).

📌 *In this way, Experiments 1–4 will be completed simultaneously as part of your personal field documentation portfolio.*

## 🔹 Stage 2: Structural Health Monitoring & Quantification (Experiment 5)

**Objective:**
Move beyond visual inspection by applying **basic monitoring and testing techniques** to quantify the extent of deterioration.

**Instructor Demonstration + Student Practice:**

* Introduction to **Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)** concepts.
* Demonstration of **Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) methods** (such as rebound hammer, ultrasonic pulse velocity, half-cell potential, cover meter, moisture meter, crack width gauges, etc.).
* Hands-on practice by students on selected structural elements within campus.

**Student Role:**

* Record readings at identified defect locations.
* Compare findings with visual observations.
* Compile results into a **Defect Diagnosis Sheet**:

  * Type of defect
  * Possible cause
  * Test result / severity
  * Suggested treatment strategy

## 🔹 Stage 3: Analytical Problem Solving (Experiment 6)

**Objective:**
Apply **engineering analysis and modeling tools** to study defects in a more systematic way.

**Tasks:**

* Follow instructor’s tutorial on the selected analysis software/tool.
* Model a structural component or problem scenario (e.g., cracked beam, corroded slab section).
* Evaluate the effect of deterioration on performance parameters (load-carrying capacity, stiffness, serviceability).
* Document outcomes as a **technical case study**.

📌 *This stage runs in parallel with Stage 1 & Stage 2 — students are expected to begin practicing with tutorials early and progressively build their analysis case study.*

## 🔹 Stage 4: Synthesis & Reporting

**Objective:**
Integrate all observations, testing data, and analytical insights into a **comprehensive problem analysis report**.

**Deliverables:**

* **Photo-logbook** of observed defects.
* **Cause–Effect–Treatment chart** for each defect type.
* **NDT & monitoring results** with interpretations.
* **Analytical case study report** (software-based evaluation).
* **Final compiled lab manual submission** (Experiment 1–6).

## 📌 General Instructions

* All field data, photos, and readings must be **self-collected** — plagiarism will not be tolerated.
* Reports should be neatly compiled in the **prescribed format** (to be shared).
* Safety precautions must be followed during site visits and testing.
* Submission deadlines will be communicated on the course homepage.
