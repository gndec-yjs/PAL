Identification and analysis of different types of cracks in buildings, with possible reasons and appropriate remedial measures.

- [**Experiment 2: Study of Corrosion in RC Components**](Experiment_2.md)  
Visual detection of corrosion in RC elements, investigation of causes, and study of possible treatment methods.

- [**Experiment 3: Study of Deflection in Structural Members**](Experiment_3.md)  
Observation and measurement of deflection in beams or slabs, with diagnosis of problems and solutions.

- [**Experiment 4: Study of Settlement in Structures**](Experiment_4.md)  
Identification of structural settlement, its underlying causes, and methods to minimize or control it.

- [**Experiment 5: Structural Health Monitoring & NDT**](Experiment_5.md)  
Evaluation of structural condition using non-destructive testing methods for quantification and diagnosis of distress.
