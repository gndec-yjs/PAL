# Experiment 6: Non-Linear Analysis of RC Structural Components using ATENA

## 1. Aim

To perform non-linear analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) structural components using ATENA software and understand the response of RC elements under realistic loading conditions.

## 2. Objectives

* To familiarize students with ATENA software for structural analysis.
* To model RC beams, slabs, and columns and perform non-linear analysis.
* To interpret software results such as stress distribution, crack formation, and deflection.
* To correlate software analysis with theoretical behavior and observed field defects.
* To encourage hands-on practice using the official ATENA tutorial.

## 3. Theoretical Background

* **Non-linear Analysis:** Captures realistic structural behavior, including cracking, crushing, and yielding of RC members.
* **ATENA Software:** Advanced tool for 2D/3D non-linear analysis of concrete and reinforced concrete structures.
* Capabilities include modeling material non-linearity, reinforcement interaction, crack propagation, and post-peak behavior.
* Students are advised to consult **case studies and examples in literature** to better understand the practical implications of non-linear analysis.

## 4. Software Installation & Tutorial

1. **Download ATENA Software:**

   * Visit [Cervenka ATENA Documentation](https://www.cervenka.cz/products/atena/documentation/) for software instructions.
   * Install the ATENA Engineering 3D trial version on your personal computer or lab workstation.

2. **Tutorial Guidance:**

   * Follow the official tutorial sheet: [ATENA Engineering 3D Tutorial PDF](https://www.cervenka.cz/assets/files/atena-pdf/ATENA-Engineering-3D_Tutorial.pdf)
   * Complete the step-by-step exercises as provided.

3. **Practice Tasks:**

   * Model a simply supported RC beam and analyze for bending and cracking.
   * Observe stress distribution and crack propagation under increasing load.
   * Record load-deflection curves and compare with theoretical expectations.
   * Document all steps, screenshots, and results in your report.

## 5. Procedure *(Sample – for reference only)*

1. Launch ATENA software and create a new project.
2. Define geometry, material properties, and boundary conditions for the RC member.
3. Assign reinforcement details as per design specifications.
4. Apply loads incrementally and perform non-linear analysis.
5. Observe and record results:

   * Crack initiation and propagation
   * Stress distribution in concrete and reinforcement
   * Maximum deflection and failure points
6. Follow the tutorial sheet and note all deviations or observations.
7. Prepare a report including screenshots, interpretation, and comparison with theoretical expectations.

## 6. Observations & Data Recording *(Sample Table – for reference only)*

| Sr. No. | RC Component                      | Load Applied | Crack Location / Type    | Max Deflection | Observed Stress | Notes / Screenshot Reference |
| ------- | --------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1       | Simply supported beam             | 20 kN        | Mid-span flexural        | 5 mm           | 28 MPa          | Screenshot\_01.png           |
| 2       | Cantilever slab                   | 15 kN        | Support region           | 3 mm           | 22 MPa          | Screenshot\_02.png           |
| 3       | Column under axial + lateral load | 50 kN        | Local crushing near base | 1 mm           | 35 MPa          | Screenshot\_03.png           |

*Students must complete a minimum of 3–4 different simulations with screenshots properly captured, numbered, and captioned in the report.*

## 7. Analysis *(Sample – for reference only)*

* Compare observed crack patterns, deflections, and stresses with theoretical predictions.
* Identify critical regions prone to failure and discuss reinforcement adequacy.
* Discuss how non-linear analysis helps in understanding real-life structural behavior.
* Reference case studies from literature for validation and deeper understanding.

## 8. Treatment / Preventive Recommendations *(Sample – for reference only)*

* Reinforcement detailing improvements for areas with high stress concentration.
* Material selection or strengthening methods for critical regions.
* Design modifications based on simulated non-linear response.
* Implement monitoring or additional NDT for in-service structures showing similar behavior.

## 9. Results *(Sample – for reference only)*

* Load-deflection curves of simulated RC members.
* Crack pattern and stress distribution diagrams.
* Critical observations from software analysis compared with theory.
* Recommendations for reinforcement or structural improvements.
